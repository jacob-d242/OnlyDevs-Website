*Before you start

Reporting bugs

*If you find a bug in the project, please report it by creating a new issue on the project's GitHub repository. Be sure to include as much information as possible *about the bug, such as the steps to reproduce it and the expected vs. actual behavior.

*Suggesting features

*If you have an idea for a new feature, please suggest it by creating a new issue on the project's GitHub repository. Be sure to describe the feature in detail and *explain why it would be beneficial to the project.

*Submitting pull requests

*When you're ready to contribute code to the project, please submit a pull request. Here are some tips for submitting a pull request:

*Create a new branch for your changes.
*Make small, incremental changes.
*Write clear and concise commit messages.
*Add tests for your changes.
*Follow the project's coding style guide.
*Once you've submitted a pull request, one of the project maintainers will review it and provide feedback. If your changes are accepted, they will be merged into the *main branch and released in the next version of the project.

*Additional guidelines

*Be respectful of other contributors and maintainers.

*Be willing to learn and improve.
*Thank you for your contributions!
*After getting the starter files, you need to go to the file directory and run
